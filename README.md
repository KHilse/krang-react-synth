# Krang React Synth

Krang is an app that allows anyone to make music. It is inspired by both retro gaming aethetics and the original experiments with synthesizers. We have attempted to create a band-in-a-page, and (humbly) we think that we were successful.

Krang was intended to be a simple app, able to be rolled out in a hurry. Krang was submitted as a project entry for General Assembly's Software Engineering Intensive Cohort 26 hackathon. It won first place. 

The fun in Krang lies in its simplicity. It contains two distinct sections: the sequencer and the theremin. The top four lines of the sequencer are a drum machine. The bottom four lines of the sequencer are piano keys. You can arrange any of these sounds in whatever sequence you would like, up to 4 musical bars. 

The second section is the theremin. A analog theremin works by detecting objects near it and change its pitch and volume based on where those objects are in relation to its antennae. Our theremin works in a very similar way! When you place and move your cursor in the box, you can modulate the sounds that the theremin makes!

# Future Work
- User changes to BPM
- User can select the sounds in the sequencer

# Technology Use:
- React
- Tone.js
- CSS3
- HTML5
